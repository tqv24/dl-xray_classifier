### Fine-tune a convolutional neural network to classify X-ray images into two categories: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA.
- Load the pre-trained ResNet-18 model in a variable called resnet18.
- Perform the appropriate adjustments to the model such that only the weights in the last layer are updated during training. Save any adjustments you make to the final layer in a variable resnet18.fc.
- Fine-tune your adjusted ResNet-18 model for only 3 epochs using the data from train_loader. You don't have to use a validation set during fine-tuning. 
- Run the provided validation cell to see your model performance; print the test_accuracy and test_f1_score and round to three decimal points.

### BONUS: 
- After the submission, you can play with your model further to see how well it can be trained. 
- You can train it for more epochs and with a validation set. 
- At the end of the provided solution, you can find a sample code that you can run to divide the training data into train and val subsets.
